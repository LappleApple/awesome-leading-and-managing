## Empathy and Listening
*"Empathy is about standing in someone else's shoes, feeling with his or her heart, seeing with his or her eyes. Not only is empathy hard to outsource and automate, but it makes the world a better place." — Daniel Pink*

- [Assholes, Jerks and Dickheads Are People Too](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/assholes-jerks-dickheads-people-too-neil-mcgregor) - by Neil McGregor. Takeaway: "There is worrying trend on LinkedIn and in the business media in general. The labelling of people into categories labelled Assholes, Jerks and Dickheads. I have to say this worries me for a number of reasons, not the least of which, is the fact that some pretty heavy hitters are using the terms and in turn influencing many others to think along similar narrow minded lines. No doubt many if not all of us have had the unfortunate opportunity to work with some difficult folk, but labelling and discarding them helps no-one." The article encourages empathy and staying focused on someone's humanity.

Leaders are wise to master it. "Empathy is a competitive advantage.

Takeaway: "When gathering requirements and performing business analysis, it is obvious that the ability to experience from within another user/customer/being's frame of reference is a valuable skill, but the same can be said when writing code. If we follow Martin Fowler’s train of thought where 'any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand' we can see that empathy is at the heart of this skill."

- [Forming Stronger Bonds with People at Work](https://hbr.org/2017/10/forming-stronger-bonds-with-people-at-work) - by Monica C. Worline, Jane E. Dutton and Ashley E. Hardin. Takeaway: "Too many people think of compassion and connection with others as a nice-to-have in organizations. But if people feel like they belong and genuinely care about one another, they will be more creative, resilient, and eager to contribute at work. It’s tempting to ignore distress, and suffering and pretend like they have no place in our offices. But the human experience of pain is going to show up, whether we invite it or not, and the only way to respond is with compassion."

- [Your Most Important Skill: Empathy](http://chadfowler.com/2014/01/19/empathy.html) - by Chad Fowler. Takeaway: Includes a long-ish list of compelling reasons why empathy truly is your most important skill as a leader, and several suggestions on how to practice empathy: listen; watch and wonder; know your enemies, and choose the other side. "We all have friends and loved ones that complain to us about how they have been treated by other people. It’s human nature to complain and it’s the duty of a loved one to listen sympathetically. The assumption is that the listener is on the side of the complainer. A supportive friend or loved one almost always is, instinctually. Try practicing (internally) taking the opposing view point. Don’t go with your default reaction immediately. Start on the other side and work your way back."
