If I have not seen as far, it is because giants were standing on my shoulders — lots of people, including Leigh Caplan*

## Intro/Context
Transitioning to leadership from software development provides the opportunity to learn a lot. [Joe Goldberg](https://twitter.com/bostonsteamer), who created the original document inspiring this list, read a crap-ton of books and articles, and took notes along the way.
 
Since 2013-ish, Joe has been keeping a collection of links and notes on the broad topics of “leadership” and “management." He shared it with friends who were transitioning to management roles but kept it private to the world at-large. Then he decided to open-source it. [Here you'll find Joe's document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R1O0OEsQpZcBcLheRlomDrmR2tyEpdRNFnjbLALmbH4/edit#heading=h.loq53mbwc6ut), which provides meatier summaries of the articles you'll find listed here as well as lots of supplementary notes.

### Why should you read this or trust the authors for advice?
You shouldn’t. Much of this is self-contradictory. Some seemed like good advice at the time. Little of it is original, even less is written by me. Don’t read this cover-to-cover. Scan the Table of Contents and pick a topic you’d like to learn more about. Joe has highlighted the absolutely most essential content (a few dozen articles, six books, and a handful of videos, checklists, and slide decks).

### How can I submit a link or ask a question?
First off, we'd love that! For submissions, follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). For questions, go ahead and post an issue in our Issues Tracker. 

### How can I get more info on [missing topic]?
Please let us know via the Issues Tracker if there’s a topic you'd like this list to include.

### Did you write all this yourself? (Credit/Attribution)
Almost none of the content shared in this list is by the authors. Where there’s a link, the content below it is generally a summary of the linked webpage. When there’s no link, it’s either original content or gives credit/attribution. Some book summaries are from [Personal MBA](https://personalmba.com/), which Joe piloted and consulted on, but not to the extent where he is willing to take credit for its content.
