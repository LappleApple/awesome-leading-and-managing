For example, who should have a say in the plan, and when? What exactly does each stakeholder need to deliver, and to whom? Who sets the timelines? Who holds everyone accountable? And who makes the final call? These questions are too often left unanswered, which leads to chaos and disappointment during the planning process."

The Framework covers these four pillars: "1. Context: Leadership shares a high-level strategy with Teams; 2. Plans: Teams respond with proposed plans; 3. Integration: Leadership integrates into a single plan, and shares with Teams; 4. Buy-in: Teams make final tweaks, confirm buy-in, and get rolling."
