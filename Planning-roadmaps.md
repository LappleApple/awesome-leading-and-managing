### Planning
- [Operating Plans for Pre-seed Startups](https://blog.bolt.io/operating-plans/) - by Axel Bichara. Takeaway: "There is no mystery to writing an operating plan.

This buys you enough time to to course-correct."

Takeaway: "[T]he root cause of nearly all bad planning processes is very simple: a basic lack of understanding of roles — who is responsible for what, when. For example, who should have a say in the plan, and when? What exactly does each stakeholder need to deliver, and to whom? Who sets the timelines? Who holds everyone accountable? And who makes the final call? These questions are too often left unanswered, which leads to chaos and disappointment during the planning process." Includes discussion of the W Framework, created by the authors to drive planning at all levels of an organization, and a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit#). The Framework covers these four pillars: "1. Context: Leadership shares a high-level strategy with Teams; 2. Plans: Teams respond with proposed plans; 3. Integration: Leadership integrates into a single plan, and shares with Teams; 4. Buy-in: Teams make final tweaks, confirm buy-in, and get rolling."

- [Technical Research and Preparation](https://keavy.com/work/technical-preparation/) - by Keavy McMinn. Takeaway: "When I’m planning to propose building a new system or functionality, I’ll typically make a spike or two (or three or four) to demonstrate the concept. By ‘spike’ I mean writing just enough code to check how something could work. The purpose of this is to gain insight, and could have different motivations."

Why are we doing it? How does this tie back to our OKRs? This is the fundamental idea behind a theme-based product roadmap – and its benefits are enormous and immediate."

- [On Writing Product Roadmaps](https://goberoi.com/on-writing-product-roadmaps-a4d72f96326c) - by Gaurav Oberoi.

Takeaway: "without considering cost of delay, validating with data, and thinking about the impact on key accounts, big pieces of the prioritization puzzle are missing...Data is more informative and concrete than consensus and gut feel.
