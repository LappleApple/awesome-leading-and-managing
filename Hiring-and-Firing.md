## Firing, Hiring, and Interviewing Candidates

### Firing
aka, “the hardest thing you’ll ever do as a manager.” First are some tips on salvaging an underperformer. Then some tips on how to fire.

- [How Do You Fire an Employee That (sic) Just Isn't Good Enough?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-fire-an-employee-that-just-isnt-good-enough/answer/Michael-O-Church) - by Michael O. Church. Takeaway: “The best employees are multipliers who make others more productive, and next are the adders (workhorses). Subtractors are the good-faith incompetents who cost more than they bring. Dividers are the worst kind of problem employee: They bring the whole team (or company) down.” Simplified as Multipliers/Adders/Subtractors/Dividers.

- [How to Terminate an Employee without Breaking their Spirit](https://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/hr-management-skills/employee-termination-tips.aspx) - by Dick Grote. Includes a checklist of questions the candidate will likely ask; come prepared with answers.

- [Letting Someone Go With Dignity](https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/letting-someone-go-with-dignity/) - by Rebekah Campbell. Takeaway: Let people save face, don't procrastinate, stick to any agreements, be clear about what happens next; announce it to the team together and let them say goodbye. Some good advice, though we're not sure you should go out for drinks with the person you just fired in every situation.

- [The Right Way to Fire Someone](https://hbr.org/2016/02/the-right-way-to-fire-someone) - by Rebecca Knight. Takeaway: Don't drag your feet; make HR your ally; keep it short; stay in the room; show compassion; talk to your team; and focus on the future.

- [Why Firing Brilliant Assholes Is Required to Build a Great Engineering Culture](http://firstround.com/review/why-firing-brilliant-assholes-is-required-to-build-a-great-engineering-culture/) - by Joe Stump (transcript by First Round). Takeaway: "Do not send a recruiter to do an engineer's job. It’s the job of founders and CTOs to be personally involved in the recruiting of the first 30 to 40 team members. Once you identify a great engineer, send your very best engineering employee who's personable to go after the person (this could be you). Make sure this individual can speak the candidate’s language and pitch them on the things that actually matter." And cultivate culture through communication.

### Hiring

- [Applied Humaning for Technical Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeV62jgu1l0) - by Cate Huston. Takeaway: In a power-based situation, the person with the power (the interviewer) owns the quality of the relationship. Don't give feedback on aspects you have no evidence for. Also: What does a good interview question look like? Answer: It should have multiple answers and tradeoffs. For developers: How does the interviewer handle the bits of the role that aren't coding?

- [Creating the Dream Team: Transform Your Engineering Organization to Attract New Talent](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2015/09/16/creating-the-dream-team-transform-your-engineering-organization-to-attract-new-talent/) - by Andrew Hao. Takeaway: Focus more on building culture than offering perks. Assess your culture, set the example, and coach.

- [Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) - by StackOverflow. Annual survey. Takeaways: When assessing potential jobs, developers prioritize "opportunities for professional development" over any other factor by a large margin; the comp/benefits selected the most often relate to mental and physical health: vacation days, remote options, and health; 89% of devs at least "somewhat agreed" that diversity is important, up from 73% in 2016; developers generally supported "c-sat" and "being on time/budget" as the best ways to evaluate the performance of a fellow dev; there's a moderate correlation between remote work and job satisfaction.

- [The Hidden Reason You Can’t Scale Your Engineering Team](https://home.opsolutely.com/the-hidden-reason-you-cant-scale-your-engineering-team/) - by Jack Danger. Takeaway: Hiring only "senior engineers" is a recipe for failure. "When a team advertises that they only hire senior engineers, what they’re really saying is that their people and technology infrastructure can’t support hiring beginners – a strong indication of fragile tooling and a fragile team. If you’re at all interested in growth, this should serve as a huge red flag, because it is extraordinarily difficult to scale a fragile team."

- [How to Hire](https://medium.com/eshares-blog/how-to-hire-34f4ded5f176) - by
  Henry Ward, CEO at eShares. Takeaways: Hiring is largely due to lack of scaling
  as a business and needing outside resources. It is more important to hire
  someone who can grow and contribute to your culture than someone who will fit
  in and have the same skillset as current hires.

- [How to Hire the Best People You've Ever Worked With](http://pmarchive.com/how_to_hire_the_best_people.html) - by Marc
  Andreessen. Breaks down hiring into two categories: Criteria and
  Process. For criteria, keep in mind people who are interested in your
  problems, who are curious enough to find solutions, and who won't waste time on
  bullshit. For process, he highlights that a lot of companies sort of hire
  randomly, with interviewers doing their own thing. And so different
  combinations give different results. Injecting some sense of consistency
  should lead to evening out your interviewing process.
  
- [How to Interview at Amazon - Leadership](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-interview-amazon-leadership-david-anderson) - by David Anderson. Takeaway: Though framed according to the activity of interviewing at Amazon and the company's principles, this detailed and thought-provoking article also provides insights on ideas on growing a team/tech organization; building a culture of customer-focused leaders; and much more.

- [How Slack Supports Junior Engineers](https://slack.engineering/how-slack-supports-junior-engineers-89f6dcfe74a1) - by Carly, a Slack engineer.

- [Let’s Stop Calling Them "Soft Skills"](https://itsyourturnblog.com/lets-stop-calling-them-soft-skills-9cc27ec09ecb#.m0rq6bldu) - by Seth Godin. Takeaways: Don't overemphasize so-called "vocational" skills.
  Real-world interpersonal skills are just as (if not more) important. Details
  categories of qualities like Self-Control, Productivity, Wisdom, Perception,
  and Influence.

- [Never, Ever Compromise: Hiring For Culture Fit](http://blog.eladgil.com/2012/04/never-ever-compromise-hiring-for.html) - by Elad Gil. Takeaway: "Your company culture is the foundation on which everything you do rests. Your culture acts as an unwritten set of rules that drives behavior and cohesion across the company. Cohesive, insular cultures are more resilient and can withstand shocks to it..." The article does point out that homogeneity of values is the idea, not homogeneity of backgrounds or personalities; however, its suggestion to use social outing tests (going to a bar) with candidates could reinforce monoculture.

- [Recruiting Diverse Engineering Candidates: What Tech Companies Still Get Wrong](https://techbeacon.com/recruiting-diverse-engineering-candidates-what-tech-companies-still-get-wrong) - by Angie Jones. Takeaway: The author describes her experiences interviewing with heavyweight tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Twitter, and reveals some of the disconcerting behaviors she witnessed during the process while praising the good. "All tech companies need to revisit their interviewing practices. Diversify the panel of people who will decide the candidate’s fate with the company; acknowledge that diverse candidates may be concerned with more than just the specifics of the job itself; and ensure that you allocate time for them to have their questions and concerns addressed. Finally, tailor the interview questions to the job for which the candidate is being considered, and steer clear of unjustified coding challenges that only serve to intimidate and stress candidates."

  your interview process reduces ability for subtle biases to creep in.
  
- [25 Tips for Diverse
  Hiring](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/25-tips-for-diverse-hiring) - by 
  Model View Culture. Takeaways: Externally, know what you want and be sure to
  actively pursue it. Internally, keep in mind hiring bias and internal culture.
  Ensure that your internals are prepared, as growing diversity is ultimately
  more important than hiring.

- [Why I Never Hire Brilliant Men](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Why_I_Never_Hire_Brilliant_Men) - by anonymous. Takeaway: Be careful with the "brilliant" word. Many brilliant people start a lot and are visionaries or charismatic, but don't finish what they started.

### Interviewing Candidates

- [A Better Way to Interview Software Engineers](https://fulcrum.lever.co/a-better-way-to-interview-software-engineers-fa9b5d2b5316) - by Zach Millman.

- [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (Version 3.0)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/) - by Joel Spolsky. Takeaway: "You should always try to have at least six people interview each candidate that gets hired, including at least five who would be peers of that candidate (that is, other programmers, not managers)...If even two of the six interviewers thinks that a person is not worth hiring, don’t hire them...The trick is telling the difference between the superstars and the maybes, because the secret is that you don’t want to hire any of the maybes. Ever." And more great wisdom from the founder of Fog Creek and StackOverflow.

- [How to Conduct a Good Programming Interview](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowtoconductagoodProgrammingInterview.html) - by Li Haoyi. Takeaway: Focus on your primary goals. Usually they are: 1) Will the candidate be able to write working code if they join the team? 2) Can the candidate discuss code and problems with the people they'll be working with? 3) Can the candidate reason about arbitrary problems and constraints? 4) Is the candidate someone we would enjoy working with? From there, Li elaborates a strategy to perform the interview, including preparation, running it and conclusions.

- [How to Interview Engineers](http://blog.triplebyte.com/how-to-interview-engineers) - by Ammon Bartram (Triplebyte). Takeaways: Ask questions similar to real work.
  Ask multipart questions. Avoid hard questions. Make decisions based on

  to trials/take-homes, even though interviews aren't the best way to
  evaluate people.
  
- [Interviewing](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/interviewing/) - by Baron Schwartz. Takeaway: Understand what you're hiring for, ask questions about past performance only, and gauge potential by "asking questions about what challenged them and how they responded to it."

- [Screen Engineers Better with a Debugging Roleplay](https://hackernoon.com/cut-to-the-chase-with-a-debugging-roleplay-d7d49f518157) - by Pete Karl II. Takeaway: Using a text-based, role-playing debugging game on a phone screen, Localytics doubled their team size within six months.

- [What Are Interviews For?](https://medium.com/tech-lead-talks/what-are-interviews-for-8130cef253a5) - by Brujo Benavides. Takeaways: The article asks whether we should use the interview process to detect cheaters, or to check how the candidate and the company fit together; and about the consequences of choosing one approach over the other.

- [You Suck at Technical Interviews](http://seldo.com/weblog/2014/08/26/you_suck_at_technical_interviews) - by Laurie Voss. Takeaways: don't hire for what candidates already know, or for what they can remember during the interview; don't hire based on elite degrees or past employers; and don't hire friends and family. Instead, interview in order to find out if the candidate can do the job, if they'll get even better at the job, if they're continuous learners who can talk intelligently about technology, and if they're aware of what they don't know. Have a conversation, not an interrogation, and ask if you actually want to work with the person.
