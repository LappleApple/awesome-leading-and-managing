- [Can You “Fix” Colleagues Who Aren’t Self-Aware?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-you-fix-colleagues-who-arent-self-aware-daniel-goleman) - by Daniel Goleman, the author of *Emotional Intelligence*.

The giver can focus on helping me."

- [The Problem with “Constructive Feedback”](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/the-problem-with-constructive-feedback/) - by Kim Scott. Takeaway: "It’s hard to sound or be humble when saying, 'I’ve got some constructive feedback for you.' This sounds like you’re saying that you know a truth that the other person doesn’t know, and you’re going to tell them this truth. It’s sort of like saying, 'You have a problem, I’m going to tell you what it is, and you’re going to fix it.'" Remember to offer praise and to remain humble.

Takeaway: "Not every problem has an easy solution. Tackling the complexity of most significant business issues can take a pool of talented people with diverse points of view. What’s more, according to Wharton professor Adam Grant, solution-only thinking creates 'a culture of advocacy instead of one of inquiry,' where each person comes into the situation locked into their way of solving the problem and lobbies hard for that particular solution rather than considering multiple perspectives."

- [The Secrets to Building a Constructive Feedback Culture](https://www.fastcompany.com/3044600/the-secrets-to-building-a-constructive-feedback-culture) - by Mark Lukens. Takeaway: "To be constructive, feedback needs to be specific, showing people where to focus their efforts in improving. It needs to focus on the product, not the person, making clear that the employee who did the work is not under attack. People who feel attacked, or who are not given a clear way forward, will become defensive and less open to feedback." Be open and considerate, and avoid casual feedback because it suggests you don't care.

- [Stop Answering Your Own Questions](https://medium.com/@skamille/stop-answering-your-own-questions-52d39fe7d3e6) - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: By answering your own questions, "I am talking to hear myself speak, rather than genuinely asking for more information that would help me understand the plan and allow me to give better feedback. By stating my preference up-front I cut off discussion. What’s worse, I make the receiver unlikely to honestly answer my question; unless, that is, they feel up to the task of debating me...If you are (or were) a highly opinionated engineer, practicing making space for information rather than quickly jumping in and sharing your conclusions is a must for leadership growth."

- [Stop Feeding Shit Sandwiches](https://m.signalvnoise.com/stop-feeding-shit-sandwiches-9364d7b9640c) - by Claire Lew.

"Soliciting constructive feedback has two key parts: When you get feedback, you need to always be receptive and never defensive or frustrated. To receive great feedback, you have to build a permissive relationship with others that means they can share it without worrying about you being…well…defensive or frustrated.

- [When It Comes to Feedback, Start with Yourself](https://blog.navapbc.com/when-it-comes-to-feedback-start-with-yourself-801684120cca) - by Alicia Liu.

If you’re having interpersonal issues while working with someone, it’s just as much on you as it is on them to change, in order to get to a better working relationship."
