Takeaway: "Defining what you value as a leader and what the shared expectations between you and your direct reports are achieves two things: 1) folks know who you are and what to expect from you, and 2) they’re much more able to give you feedback and hold you accountable. If they know what you believe and expect as manager, folks will feel more confident that any behaviour of yours that’s not aligned is likely unintended and something you’d be eager to hear about and fix."
