## Building Products and Startups

As a leader of a product development team you might have a PM that you’re working with, but some of your role will involve deciding how/when product is built, who builds what, etc. So you’ll need to level up your product skills.

Takeaway: Offers a step-by-step template for creating a 1-3 page technical research outline that will enable product leads to communicate plans more effectively with developers, who can then better do the research on their side required to build a product successfully. "The outline should be a short summary of what you’re looking to create, including required features and functionality. You should also provide guidance on what matters most to you (and customers).

But clinging to it will limit your growth trajectory. Like the overgrown fly, lack of process will crush your company. You need to change your ways of working to fit the company’s size. But this doesn’t have to be terrible. It totally can be terrible, if you do it wrong. Even if you do it right, it will change and even get rid of some of your company’s original goodness.

- [The MVP is dead. Long live the RAT.](https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-is-dead-long-live-the-rat-233d5d16ab02) - by Rik Higham. Takeaway: "There is a flaw at the heart of the term Minimum Viable Product: it’s not a product. It’s a way of testing whether you’ve found a problem worth solving. A way to reduce risk and quickly test your biggest assumption. Instead of building an MVP identify your Riskiest Assumption and Test it. Replacing your MVP with a RAT will save you a lot of pain."

- [Notes from “Good Strategy / Bad Strategy”](https://jlzych.com/2018/06/27/notes-from-good-strategy-bad-strategy/) - by Jeff Zych. Takeaway: a focused overview of the book by UCLA Anderson School of Management professor Richard P. Rumelt. “Strategy is designing a way to deal with a challenge. A good strategy, therefore, must identify the challenge to be overcome, and design a way to overcome it. To do that, the kernel of a good strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.” Includes some critical thoughts on OKRs.

- [Observations on Product Management](https://medium.com/hackernoon/observations-on-product-management-3abc7e00148e) - by Dan Hill. Takeaway: "Most Product Managers (and everyone probably) spend too little time thinking about how to solve a problem. They jump straight into solving it. Problems come in different shapes, and not all need the same process. The process that shipped the last product is unlikely to be the one that you need for the next...Incremental development and vision are not orthogonal; they both require the other. All product must start with a vision — a point of view — but then be built critically step by step. It’s ok to learn something new as you go."

- [The Only Metric That Matters — Now With Fancy Slides!](https://news.greylock.com/the-only-metric-that-matters-now-with-fancy-slides-232474cf414c) - by Josh Elman at Greylock Partners.

- [Product Discovery Anti-Patterns Leading to Failure](https://age-of-product.com/product-discovery-anti-patterns/) - by Stefan Wolpers.

- [Product Manager vs. Product Owner](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2017/06/29/product-manager-vs-product-owner) - by Melissa Perri. Takeaway: "A good Product Manager is taught how to prioritize work against clear outcome oriented goals, how to discover and validate real customer and business value, and what processes are needed to reduce the uncertainty that the product will succeed in market. Without this background in Product Management, someone can effectively go through the motions of Product Owner role in Scrum, but they can never be successful in making sure they are building the right thing." 

- [The Product Manager Superpower: User Science](https://medium.com/@tworetzky/the-product-manager-superpower-user-science-7296134ae5a4) - by Brent Tworetzky. Takeaway: "While finding the perfect user-product fit is rarely easy, trained product managers can find great fits consistently with User Science–the field of deeply understanding people interacting with products through rigorous toolings and process. User science involves understanding both user needs (identifying which problem to solve) and user behaviors (understanding how and why users react to products). This distinction is important: winning products need both a meaningful problem to solve and strong execution."

- [Product Strategy Means Saying No](http://www.productstrategymeanssayingno.com/) - by Intercom. Takeaways: Review common
  reasons for making product decisions and ask whether they are actually good for the product.
  
- [Reminder: Your “Product” Company is Just an Implementation Detail](https://medium.com/from-the-start/building-a-feature-697344aefda2) - by Jeremy Baker. Takeaway: The progress our customer wants to make is the most important thing. We think about our features and what they can do, and present them that way. When we do this, we’re "forcing our customer to do the hard work. They have to map features to their process and figure out if it helps them make progress ... Instead, talk about the progress our customer wants to make, and build tools that enable that progress."

- [Risk Assessment and Prioritization for Startups](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ox9mwO7aCfwXUw1pllKTKCpiEJi3oIW6KHrXfNtrIXQ/edit#slide=id.p) - by Leo Polovets. Takeaway: a slide deck about the value of addressing risks head-on, and early. Includes self-assessment tips.

Continuously identify the next most important problem we should be solving for our customers. We’ve written about this in the past.

Find the optimal set of tradeoffs between product scope and engineering costs in solving the problem."

The post provides these questions, to help you become less reactive and more proactive in managing your growth.

- [Transforming from Projects to Products](https://www.infoq.com/articles/transform-projects-products) - by John Yorke. Takeaway: "Agile Transformation means thinking of Products rather than Projects. Agile is a Mindset not a set of rules to be followed. It requires a cultural change not a process change. Agile changes the way we measure project success and how we measure people's behaviour. Change is Hard. Project Management and People Management are those that need to change the most."

- [The Ultimate Question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsmy2GqHL-9IjEc0Q88tsSYafHJQXtgK0P8pJWKOTAs/edit) - notes by Joe Goldberg about the book by Fred Reichheld, which focuses on measurements like the net promoter score (NPS).

- [What Happens When Startups Turn from Their Innovation Stage to Operational Excellence?](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/what-happens-when-startups-turn-from-their-innovation-stage-to-operational-excellence-91bee1540e66) - by Mark Suster. Takeaway: "Startups are fun and exhilarating and filled with challenging problems to solve. To the neophyte it seems like startup challenges are strictly product or technical in nature but to innovate, systematize and scale a billion dollar company it involves way more decisions about strategy, economics, resource allocations and team composition."

- [When, Which...Design Thinking, Lean, Design Sprint, Agile?](https://blog.usejournal.com/when-which-design-thinking-lean-design-sprint-agile-a4614fa778b9) - by Geert Claes. Takeaway: “It probably makes more sense to just look at Design Thinking, Lean, Design Sprint & Agile as a bunch of tools and techniques in one’s toolbox, rather than argue for one over the other, because they can all add value somewhere on the innovation spectrum.”

- [Why Software Sucks](http://scottberkun.com/essays/46-why-software-sucks/) - by Scott Berkun. Good ways to think about why it happens and what you can do to make it happen less.

- [Why OKRs Are Not Delivering the Result Executive Managers Expect](https://luis-goncalves.com/okrs/?__s=zmnhwriwrwhonuvpmtq8) - by Veronika Goncalves. Takeaway: "In many cases, when organizations apply OKRs, they apply the process the in the same format as Management by Objectives: using a Top-Down Approach. But this format does not create value for the organization because the top managers do not understand what the customer’s real problems are. When defining the objectives, they are usually not in alignment with the company’s current reality." Also, OKRs might not be the right framework for every company; consider options like agile portfolio management.
