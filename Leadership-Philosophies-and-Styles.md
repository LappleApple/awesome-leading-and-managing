## Leadership Philosophies and Styles

### Leadership Philosophies
This topic comes first, because the following articles offer great frameworks/definitions for leadership.

- [Actions Reflect Leadership — Not Words](https://blog.knowyourcompany.com/actions-reflect-leadership-not-words-ca65ca26790a) - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: "Studies have found that the biggest reason for why people don’t speak up at work is because they believe it is futile. Employees don’t think anything will happen with their feedback ... so they don’t give it ... If you want honest feedback, you must act on the feedback you’ve gotten in some way. Prove to employees it’s worth their effort to be honest with you."

- [Average Manager vs. Great Manager, Explained in 10 Sketches](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/average-manager-vs-great-manager-cf8a2e30907d) - by Julie Zhuo (VP Product Design, Facebook). Go look at these, they’re humorous and poignant. It’ll only take a minute.

- [The Best Leaders Are Constant Learners](https://hbr.org/2015/10/the-best-leaders-are-constant-learners) - HBR article by Kenneth Mikkelsen and Harold Jarche. Takeaway: "Leaders that stay on top of society’s changes do so by being receptive and able to learn."

- [The Best Management Is Less Management](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Best-Management-Is-Less-Management) - by Michael Useem and Harbir Singh. Takeaway: "[W]hen time is limited and stakes are high, the most effective leaders rely on their ranks to do what they do best. These leaders empower people to use their expertise to solve problems and achieve goals. They also enable managers at every level of the organization to think like CEOs, making decisions with a large degree of autonomy. There’s a clear system in place for monitoring progress, but it doesn’t impede people from getting the work done. This is strategic leadership at its best, and in a moment of crisis it becomes all the more critical."

- [CEO Coaches](https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/ceo-coaches) - by Alex McCaw. Takeaway: Thoughts on why CEOs should consider getting a coach, shaped by the author's own experiences.

Martin. Takeaway: "1. Make only the set of choices you are more capable of making than anyone else. 2. Explain the choice that has been made and the reasoning behind it. 3. Explicitly identify the next downstream choice. 4. Assist in making the downstream choice, as needed. 5. Commit to revisit and modify the choice based on downstream feedback."

- [Close Encounters: Leadership And Handwritten Notes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/04/06/close-encounters-leadership-and-handwritten-notes/?sh=3c61d4543e96#4564a7b13e96) - by Rodger Dean Duncan. Takeaway: about the leadership style of CEO Douglas Conant, who daily wrote 20 handwritten messages to employees celebrating their contributions and strove to interact with people face-to-face. 

- [Developing the Leader Within You 2.0](https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Developing-the-Leader-Within-You-20_p_2792.html) - by John C. Maxwell. Takeaway: "...leaders are not born, they're made"; “Good leaders don’t just resolve the issue to get it off their plates quickly for the sake of their own comfort. They help create solutions that take their people and their organization forward and put them in a better position than they were in before they experienced the problem.” 

- [The Difference Between Amateurs and Professionals](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/08/amateurs-professionals/) - by Farnam Street. Takeaway: a series of bullet points identifying the differences. Examples: "Amateurs give up at the first sign of trouble and assume they’re failures. Professionals see failure as part of the path to growth and mastery;
Amateurs don’t have any idea what improves the odds of achieving good outcomes. Professionals do."

Takeaway: Be humble, not charismatic; be steady and dependable; remember that modesty is the best policy, balance analysis with action, be vigilant — vulnerability increases over time.

- [Effective Leaders](https://medium.com/@brendan_ward/effective-leaders-6f36e891706e) - by Brendan Ward. Takeaway: effective leaders set, communicate, and reinforce tangible goals toward broader impact. They set priorities and act strategically, share the opportunity to lead, and listen more than they talk. They are highly introspective, actively seek feedback, grow from their mistakes, and are constantly learning across a broad range of topics.

Takeaway: Start with the why, communicate often, and allow for facetime.

- [The Future of Management](https://shift.newco.co/the-future-of-management-5914beda43d2) - by Esko Kilpi. Takeaway: "The future is accordingly described as goals and performance targets. Following this logic, the role of management is to control the movement into a chosen future. But what management really is, is about reduction of anxiety. Anxiety levels in the experiences of individuals most often depend on the perceived level of control people have over themselves and their environment. This drives our need to believe that someone is, or should be, in control."

- [Good Leaders Are Good Learners](https://hbr.org/2017/08/good-leaders-are-good-learners) - by Lauren A. Keating, Peter A. Heslin and Susan J. Ashford.

- [Good Technology Leadership Is Rare](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/good-technology-leadership-rare-sam-mcafee/) - by Sam McAfee. Takeaway: "After 20 years in this field, I'd say without hesitation that usually about 80% of the problem is with the leadership itself. Now I have to look a senior leader square in the eye and tell them that, in fact, they are actually the problem. That their people learned all of their behaviors from the modeling of the leader. That they set the tone in terms of what is acceptable to talk about openly, and what is strictly off limits. And the vast majority of these signals from leadership are extremely subtle, not necessarily intended to be signals at all."

Technical Expertise Came in Dead Last](https://www-inc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.inc.com/amp/154561.html) - by Michael Schneider. Takeaway: Tech expertise is worth little if a manager is not committed to communicating clearly/effectively, developing people and removing obstacles so they can get things done.

- [Hallmarks of a Good Technical Leader](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/hallmarks-of-a-good-technical-leader) - by Brian Anderson and Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "Good technical leaders are capable of understanding systems through many different lenses. They understand that their companies are shaped by people and technologies and processes, and they’re capable of investigating each of these areas to understand how it contributes to the current success or challenges of the team. Good technical leaders have a strong sense of technical empathy, which helps them appreciate the challenges their engineers are facing, even if those engineers are working on problems that the leader has never personally written code to solve. Finally, good technical leaders have good technical judgment."

- [High-Performing Teams Need Flexible Leaders](https://medium.com/@srikardoddi/high-performing-teams-need-flexible-leaders-9243e7ec6e95) - by Srikar Doddi. Takeaway: Offers insights into how to change your style based on the needs of the team.
