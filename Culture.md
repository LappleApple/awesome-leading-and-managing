- [Changing Company Culture Requires a Movement, Not a Mandate](https://hbr.org/2017/06/changing-company-culture-requires-a-movement-not-a-mandate) - by Bryan Walker and Sarah A. Soule.

Someone with authority can demand compliance, but they can’t dictate optimism, trust, conviction, or creativity." This also applies to the best-intentioned culture changes, including agile transformations. You might have the best intentions in the world, but if your team doesn't see the value or direction of the change, don't expect them to adapt.

The motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional form of sacrifice: Yours."

- [On Failure and Resilience](https://beero.ps/2017/06/17/on-failure-and-resilience/) - by Katherine Daniels.

This is a major disruption that impacts everyone, don't just do it for fun."
