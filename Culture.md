Takeaway: Signs include a lack of a constructive cross-functional conversation; customers are no longer central to the conversation; you are unsure what other functions are really doing; there's rampant “blame-storming” and separate cultural identities; things are portrayed as a “zero sum” game; and you’ve given up trying to become a better organization.

- [The Buffer Culture](http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-03) (slides) - a deck about Buffer's unique culture, which reinforces transparency, self-improvement and positivity, among other elements.

- [Buffer Sees Clear Benefits to Transparent Employee Salary Policy](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/3/social-startup-buffer-transparency-reigns?sc_cid=701600000011jJkAAI) - by Bryan Behrenshausen. Takeaway: "At social media startup Buffer, a single leadership decision eliminated salary negotiation for new employees, preempted gender-based salary discrimination, and prompted a flood of job applications. The decision? Make all employee salaries transparent."

- [Building the Civilized Workplace](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/building-the-civilized-workplace) - by Robert Sutton. Takeaway: "Nasty people don’t just make others feel miserable; they create economic problems for their companies."

- [Changing Company Culture Requires a Movement, Not a Mandate](https://hbr.org/2017/06/changing-company-culture-requires-a-movement-not-a-mandate) - by Bryan Walker and Sarah A. Soule. Takeaway: "[C]ulture change can’t be achieved through top-down mandate. It lives in the collective hearts and habits of people and their shared perception of 'how things are done around here.' Someone with authority can demand compliance, but they can’t dictate optimism, trust, conviction, or creativity." This also applies to the best-intentioned culture changes, including agile transformations. You might have the best intentions in the world, but if your team doesn't see the value or direction of the change, don't expect them to adapt.

- [Collaboration at Scale](https://medium.com/@ran_than/collaboration-at-scale-b27f17b4614a) - by Ranganathan Balashanmugam. Takeaway: "Collaboration becomes difficult with organizational growth. So, hierarchy may not be easily eliminated as the organization grows but can be implemented well — by respecting diversity and better ways of adopting and implementing authority and decision making. Choose a model that is not coming in the way of collaboration and works in the context of the organization."

- [Company Culture Is Shaped at the Top, and Forms at the Bottom](https://www.coderhood.com/on-company-culture/) - by Lorenzo Pasqualis. Takeaway: "A company culture is an overall personality that results from the interactions between its people, and the environment in which employees work.

- [The Company Isn’t a Family](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-company-isnt-a-family-d24f26c3f3fe) - by David Heinemeier Hansson. Takeaway: "Whenever executives talk about how their company is really like a big ol’ family, beware. They’re usually not referring to how the company is going to protect you no matter what or love you unconditionally. You know, like healthy families would. The motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional form of sacrifice: Yours."

- [Creating Psychological Safety: Start with Trust](https://medium.com/@Alyss/creating-psychological-safety-part-1-ac9aa733fa9b) by Alyss Noland. Takeaway: Psychological safety is a combination of trust between coworkers and an environment where that trust can be acted upon. Start with building those bridges between peers, providing managerial support, and creating a strategic narrative that uplifts every team's accomplishments.

- [Crush the Wall!…of your Departments to Build 100% Agile Company. This Is How We Did It](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crush-wallof-your-departments-build-100-agile-company-tomas-laboutka) - by Tomas Laboutka. Takeaway: "Without full alignment and team empowerment, a company will not be able to make good decisions and execute quickly. Some studies point out that for every 1 hour of work done by product teams, 48 minutes is spent waiting for a decision to be made. That means in one 8-hour day, 3.5 hours is dedicated to waiting. This is crazy."

- [Culture Is the Behavior You Reward and Punish](https://jocelyngoldfein.com/culture-is-the-behavior-you-reward-and-punish-7e8e75c6543e) - by Jocelyn Goldfein. Takeaway: Employees will work to emulate other successful employees. Success is what happens _publicly_. If successful people in a company all behave similarly, then alignment and culture flow from that.

- [The Culture Cliché](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-culture-clich%C3%A9-e226cf5a6354) - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: If you’re looking to shift your company culture, it starts with understanding what culture is in the first place.

- [Culture Is the Spec, Process Is the Code](https://medium.com/@richarmstrong/culture-is-the-spec-process-is-the-code-ccb0df70514f) - by Rich Armstrong. Takeway: Create every process around your culture. Just like your devs need specs in order to know what code to write, your company needs processes in order to implement culture. 

- [Emailing While You’re on Vacation Is a Quick Way to Ruin Company Culture](https://hbr.org/2017/12/emailing-while-youre-on-vacation-is-a-quick-way-to-ruin-company-culture) - by Katie Denis. Takeaway: "Every email sent by a vacationing employee is a tiny cultural erosion: a signal to other employees that time off isn’t really time off. In aggregate, these tiny erosions matter. They send signals like 'I don’t trust you to do the job without me,' or 'I’m not organized enough to wrap up my loose ends before I go on vacation.' Either way, they erode perceptions of your likability and competence."

- [Engineering a Culture of Psychological Safety](https://www.intercom.com/blog/psychological-safety/) - by John Looney.

Takeaway: A healthy workplace offers uninterrupted time, heated debate, access to the top leadership, reasons to value and be proud of it, and a culture of selflessness.

- [Five Years, Building a Culture, and Handing It Off](http://laughingmeme.org/2015/08/31/five-years-building-a-culture-and-handing-it-off) - by Kellan Elliott-McCrea. Takeaway: Build a culture of learning, generosity and values.

- [Focus on Culture When Building an Engineering Culture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/focus-engineering-culture) - by Sujith Nair. Takeaway: "Culture cannot be enforced, but only facilitated. Hiring is crucial in building and sustaining great engineering culture. Continuous learning helps create the right engineering team environment. Self-driven teams with minimum directions are ideal teams that we all should aspire for. An environment without red-tape and unnecessary controls will help engineering innovation, productivity & quality."

- [Gross Company Happiness](https://clearbit.com/blog/gross-company-happiness/) - by Alex MacCaw. Takeaway: the CEO of Clearbit describes how and why the company is tracking this metric.

- [Hard to Communicate with Other Teams? Check out These Tips](https://opensource.com/open-organization/17/7/communicate-teams-tips) - by Jonas Rosland. Takeaway: "[L]earning more about why a team is working on a specific project, not just focusing on how they're involved and what the project is about, can help you foster better relationships across your organization. Focusing on why people act the way they do allows teams to better understand one another's goals and purposes, and helps everyone assume the best intentions from everyone involved in an effort."

- [Hearts and Minds: Shaping Dev Culture Through Technical Training](https://medium.com/@karen_meep/hearts-and-minds-shaping-dev-culture-through-technical-training-3c9c6ed49ce6) - by Karen Cohen. Takeaway: "[W]e have to make sure we don’t lose our culture. Left unattended, it will turn into ‘null culture’. It’s what happens when no formal culture is put into place. It leaves people guessing what is socially acceptable and creates an impossible environment for those who guess wrong. It’s not the type of environment that makes employees want to stick around."

"Generally speaking, and certainly if a company is working well to some degree— if you’re making progress in building the product you want to build and the service you want to create, and if the organization is growing and customers are adopting—there are empirically some things about your culture that are working well. And I often see companies making a mistake by being too abashed about simply being specific about those."

Dan Pink's autonomy, mastery, and purpose are also common themes. Diversity is also important for some of these companies because, as research shows, diverse teams are more effective than homogeneous ones.

- [Let’s Talk About Your Plan to Run a Consequence-Free Company](https://mfbt.ca/lets-talk-about-your-plan-to-run-a-consequence-free-company-72ff4a095fec) - by Johnathan Nightingale. Takeaway: "The failure to be basically decent, and to build an organization that values decency, builds up. Like technical debt, it comes more from ignorance and expediency than malice. Some leaders are sociopaths, no doubt, but I think most would insist that they aren’t trying to make things awful. They just never bothered to give enough of a shit to make them better."

- [Nails in the Coffin: Why a Flat Organizational Structure Fails](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/flat-organizational-structure-fails/) - by Lighthouse. Takeaway: GitHub, Zappos, Medium and others have abandoned flat hierarchies because you can’t manage everyone yourself; they slow things down; unspoken lines of communication and decision making form; you miss or become overwhelmed by problems; you waste time re-inventing the wheel; important decisions can become a mess. Instead of flat hierarchy, develop your leaders instead.

- [On Leadership and Culture](https://hackernoon.com/on-leadership-and-culture-ca4d6f2a9bb0?source=linkShare-d0a0152ff0c0-1520995699) - by Jason Warner.

It's not a fact of life—you end up with suboptimal solutions by it.

Selfless leadership—company, team, then self, in that order—is the essential ingredient in all of this for driving the best solutions.

- [Respect for People - Lean's Neglected Pillar](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/respect-lean) (video) - by Jon Terry, of LeanKit. Takeaway: What "respect for people" means is open to interpretation. Reading a lot of books and articles isn't a quick-fix to understanding it. Understanding that people are motivated by purpose and staying in touch with continuous improvement helps to reinforce respect for people.

Takeaway: "Leading an open organization—where hierarchy cedes much of its control to dynamic, networked structures—feels much more like maintaining a perennial garden. It involves working more on conditions (turning soil, locating those spots in need of watering) than it does on dictating direction. It means creating the context for things (things you might not have considered or even imagined) to occur."

- [What Company Culture IS and IS NOT](https://moz.com/rand/what-company-culture-is-and-is-not/) - by Rand.
