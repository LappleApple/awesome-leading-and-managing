- [Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) - by StackOverflow. Annual survey.

If you’re at all interested in growth, this should serve as a huge red flag, because it is extraordinarily difficult to scale a fragile team."

  someone who can grow and contribute to your culture than someone who will fit
  in and have the same skillset as current hires.

- [How to Hire the Best People You've Ever Worked With](http://pmarchive.com/how_to_hire_the_best_people.html) - by Marc
  Andreessen. Breaks down hiring into two categories: Criteria and
  Process. For criteria, keep in mind people who are interested in your
  problems, who are curious enough to find solutions, and who won't waste time on
  bullshit. For process, he highlights that a lot of companies sort of hire
  randomly, with interviewers doing their own thing. And so different
  combinations give different results. Injecting some sense of consistency

These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make."
